## What is whiteboarding?
Whiteboarding is the practice of asking a technical job interview applicant to
write code to a pet problem, typically on a dry-erase whiteboard. While
originally promoted as a way to inspire conversation about a candidates’
approach to a problem, the use and meaning of whiteboarding has morphed into
“Implement Foo algorithm,” on the whiteboard. This is wrong because it assumes
rote memorization of a given algorithm or the steps needed to solve a particular
problem.

## What is live-coding?
Live-coding is a practice very similar to whiteboarding. The difference is,
a candidate may be able to use a computer. Whether or not they can compile / run
their code depends heavily upon the environment provided to the candidate. Some
companies just use a Google Doc. Others use purpose-built tooling such as
Coderpad, Stypi, etc.

## Why is whiteboarding and live-coding bad?
Whiteboarding and live-coding is a bad practice because these skills are
discrete from those required for most software engineering positions. These
interviews only measure a candidate's interview skills; not their actual
technical skills.
