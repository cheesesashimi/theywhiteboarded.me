Hello,

Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the Site Reliability Engineer
position at `$company`. I appreciate the time and effort you've invested with
me in your interview process. I admit I could have done a lot better, but as
a technical interviewer myself, I know that interviews are subject to high
variance on both the interviewer and candidate ends. While disappointed with
the outcome, I want to take this opportunity to provide some candid feedback
about your interview process with the hope it may be improved.

What went well:

- The interviewer who conducted my phone screen (`$phone_interviewer`) was very
  engaging and asked relevant questions about my background and overall,
  portrayed `$company`'s SRE team in a very positive light.
- Three of the five onsite interviewers (`$interviewer_1`, `$interviewer_2` and
  `$interviewer_3`) offered a great experience and were actively engaged in the
  interviews. Were all of my interviewers like this, I would have had a more
  enjoyable experience, regardless of outcome.
- The recruiting staff (`$recruiter_1`, `$recruiter_2` and `$recruiter_3`)
  I worked with were great and proactive with scheduling and moving forward.
- The onsite recruiting coordinator (`$recruiter_2`) was diligent in ensuring
  I was well-hydrated and kept the interviews on schedule.
- Overall process speed was very fast from initial contact to decision.

What did not go well:

- `$interviewer_4` and `$interviewer_5` were disengaged, disinterested and
  robotic. Not only did they make no engagement effort, they actively avoided
  engagement throughout the course of the interview. Their confirmation bias
  was palpable, having formed an immutable opinion of me within the first 60
  seconds of the interview. Both were condescending and appeared intent on
  conducting a deposition as opposed to a bilateral interview. Overall, these
  are not the type of people I would want to work with.
- `$interviewer_5` chose an off-putting deposition-style interview. Toward the
  end, he asked a wildly inappropriate and irrelevant brain-teaser-style
  question about the average angle of circles.
- `$interviewer_4` opted for trivia questions, which do nothing to assess
  a candidate's technical strength; only whether a candidate has rote
  memorization of a given command / concept. When I blanked on a few things,
  I’m certain `$interviewer_4` interpreted it as not being technically skilled
  enough as opposed to just not knowing the name of a specific command or its
  behavior; thus the problem with asking trivia questions in an interview.
  Additionally, even though this specific interview was conducted via
  a videoconferencing setup, it was obvious `$interviewer_4` was not devoting
  his full attention to the interview; due to his mechanical keyboard. This is
  very inconsiderate because of the time commitment I made to being fully
  present and available for this interview.
- For the programming portion of the interview, I was subjected to a whiteboard
  coding exercise. Whiteboard coding is an outdated and outmoded technique for
  assessing programming skills. Even the interviewer who did my whiteboarding
  interview (`$interviewer_2`) acknowledged this, yet proceeded anyway.
  Whiteboarding is known to produce a lot of false-negatives since it is
  a distinct skill that not all programmers have. That doesn’t mean they’re bad
  or inexperienced programmers.
- Only two of my interviewers (`$interviewer_3` and `$interviewer_4`) allocated
  time for me to ask questions. Of those two, only `$interviewer_3` was
  genuinely interested in speaking with me and took a great amount of time and
  care in answering my questions. `$interviewer_4` opted to provide terse and
  condescending answers.
- Four of the five interviewers showed no concern for my well-being, leaving
  this task to the interview coordinator, who was diligent in ensuring I was
  well-hydrated. However, at no point until just before the last interview
  began was I afforded an opportunity to step out of the interview room. Being
  confined in a dark and uncomfortable space for 4 hours is demoralizing and
  does little to help one think clearly.

As you can see, this was not the most positive interview experience and doesn’t
portray `$company` in the most flattering way. Given `$company`’s track record
of disruption and innovation, I expected a more out-of-the-box interview
approach and a more positive experience, doubly-so when `$company` claims there
is a local talent shortage.

In the interest of giving back, here is a talk I gave to my city's local tech
community about the deleterious effect tech interviewing has on candidates:

Despite my feelings about the interview, I'm happy to provide additional
details about my experience, should you wish. Either way, I wish you the best
of luck in your talent search.

Sincerely,

A Rejected Candidate
