Hello `$recruiter`,

Thank you for reaching out to me about this position. While the job description
sounds like something I would be a great fit for and would excel at, I realize
that should I interview for this position, the skills evaluated will be my
interviewing skills instead of my technical ones. For example, `$company` is
currently found on [they.whiteboarded.me](http://they.whiteboarded.me), a
curated list of tech companies known to use high-pressure interview tactics
such as live-coding and whiteboarding. Not only that, setting aside the
outcome, my previous interview experience at `$company` was not a positive one.
While I admit I could have done better, I do not believe the interview process
allowed me to put my best foot forward.

I had significant difficulty working with my interviewer who was very
challenging to communicate with and who constantly interrupted me. I was asked
to live-code a problem in a web browser, which is a very unnatural development
environment for any programmer. Given the context, limited time and poor
tooling, this makes coming up with a solution unnecessarily difficult and
stressful. I got hung up on some minutiae and was penalized for an incorrect
assumption about how something worked. In the real world, I could have easily
proven or disproven my assumption. When the inevitable rejection came, it was
unnecessarily condescending, stating, “We are pursuing stronger candidates than
you.”

Needless to say, this does not portray `$company` in a positive light. In
closing, I apologize if I came off as negative or condescending, which is not
my intention. I’m known for being candid, sometimes brutally so. Looking
forward, I’d like to give something back. I’d like to point you to a talk I
gave last year about the deleterious effects technical interviews have on tech
workers
([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIrKC41NwC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIrKC41NwC0)).
Additionally, I’d like to provide a curated list of links about why current
technical interview practices are flawed with some recommendations on how we
can fix them:
([http://they.whiteboarded.me/additional-resources.html](http://they.whiteboarded.me/additional-resources.html)).

I enjoy working in this industry and because of that, I’ve taken the time to
provide you with this candid feedback with the hope that `$company` can
improve its process.

Sincerely,

A Disinterested Candidate
