## Introduction

From coding challenges that measure the wrong things, to demoralizing
whiteboarding or live-coding interviews that only seem to cause and placate
impostor syndrome, reduce diversity and place applicants under significant
stress, it is obvious that things are broken.

It's time that tech workers demand a better interview process. How do we do
that? Simple!

## Step 1
Review [the list](/companies-that-whiteboard.html) of companies.

## Step 2

### I'm looking for a job
If you are looking for a job, only apply and accept interview requests with
companies that do not whiteboard. A handy list of companies that do not
whiteboard may be found, courtesy of [Hiring Without
Whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards). Decline
interview requests with companies that do. Be sure to explain why you are
declining to interview with a given company.

If you encounter a company that is not on either list, please [get in touch](/contact.html)!

Whiteboards](https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards) would love

people headed your way!

### I am not looking for a job and my company whiteboards
Please have a look at why [whiteboarding is
bad](/interview_types/whiteboarding_and_live_coding.html). This next part is
easier said than done, but please fix your process. It will benefit you in the
long run. Plus, you will be removed from [the list](/companies-that-whiteboard.html).
